# dbd-all-perk-streak

Tutorial:
NOTE* You need to have python installed to use this. https://www.python.org/downloads/   (When installing Python, enable add to PATH.)

1. Download the files as a zip.
2. Unzip the files somewhere you want
3. Launch the .bat file to startup the server
4. Go to your browser and type http://localhost:8000

If I ever stop updating, it's very simple to add in new killers, survivors and perks.
 1. Download the perk/character icon. As a .webp file.
 2. Put in in assets\perks or characters\killers or survivors.
 3. Go into the characters.json and copy one already in their and update the info to the new names and file name.
